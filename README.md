A tool for creating tunnels to Dahua cameras (by serial number) and forwarding any port to localhost via the Dahua DH HTTP P2P cloud protocol. Essentially, an improved version of DH-P2P.

## Improvements 

- Supports **forwarding multiple ports at once**
- Supports **multithreading**
- Can build stable tunnels

### Not tested
 - Type 1 Auth support

> [!NOTE]
> Dahua may reject requests due to time mismatch.

## Build

Requires Go 1.26+.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/undervolter/dh-fwd
cd dh-fwd
go build -o dh-fwd .

```
## Usage
```sh
dh-fwd [options] <serial>

```
Or:
```sh
./dh-fwd <serial> [options]

```

### Flags
| Flag | Short | Description |
|---|---|---|
| --debug | -d | Verbose protocol debug output (requests, STUN packets, PTCP frames) |
| --port | -p | Port mapping (see below) |
| --threads | -mt | Number of threads (default 3) |
| --pool | - | Counter of pools |
| --smart-pss | -2 | Forwards ports 80 and 37777 at the same time |
| --help | -h | Show command list |
### Port Syntax (--port)
There are two ports: **local** (the one we listen on) and **remote** (the one the camera exposes).
 * **Left side:** local port
 * **Right side:** remote port
 * If only one port is specified (e.g., -p 80), remote port 80 will be opened on **any free local port**.
**Examples:**
 * -p 5080,5081,5082:80,81,82 — explicit pairs "local:remote", one-to-one
 * -p 8080,8081,8082:80 — multiple local ports to one remote port
 * -p 80-85 — port range
 * 0:81 — local port 0 means "any free port"
 * If no port is specified, default port 554 is used.
Local ports are bound to localhost.

> [!WARNING]
> If you run the software without the -p flag or specify a listening port <1024 without running the program with sudo, you may encounter the following error:
> ```sh
> Tunnel failed, reason - no listeners available for tunnel
> ```

## Modes
**Single** — forwards only 1 port:
```sh
./dh-fwd SN -p 5080:80

```
**Multi** — forwards multiple ports simultaneously. Activates automatically if multiple ports are specified, or if -mt is explicitly set:
```sh
./dh-fwd SN -p 5080,5081:80,81 -mt 4

```
```text
Opening 2 ports on SN | Threads: 3
[..] Opening SN:80 | Connecting...
[OK] Obtained SN:80 -> 127.0.0.1:5080
[OK] Obtained SN:81 -> 127.0.0.1:5081
Obtained 2 ports on SN:80,81 | localhost:5080,5081

```

## What is Dahua P2P protocol?
This is a proprietary Dahua cloud protocol used to connect to cameras via the cloud, even if the device is behind multiple NATs. The connection sequence operates as follows: the client (SmartPSS or dh-fwd) sends a request to the main server → receives an intermediate server → creates a communication channel → attempts NAT traversal → establishes a tunnel.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Until 2025, Dahua P2P servers established tunnels without mandatory authentication. Following reported protocol vulnerabilities, devices released after late 2024 require authentication **BEFORE** establishing a tunnel.
